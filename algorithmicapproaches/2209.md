## SAT Solving
Boolean Satisfiability Problem
+ We make a tree which represents the rows of the truth table (ie. complete assignments to the propositional variables)
  + Only one leaf node, needs to make the propositional formula true for the formula to be satisfiable
+ We evaluate by clauses, using complete assignment. We check if consequent clauses are true given the implied values of the variable from previous clauses

#### Eight Queens
